# Intel4Dummies
PHP tool to recovery information about domains and IPs.

## Requirements

You need to install a php environment. You can use LAMP, MAMP, XAMP or you can upload it to a server with Apache. Once you have the files on the server you only have to navigate to the path to them and follow the steps contained in the usage part.

## Usage

You need to put domains in the text box:

## Note

It is not programmed as I usually do so I promise that in the future it will be improved and implemented with better programming. 
My intention is to continue adding functionalities as I have time to do so. Suggestions or help are welcome for this tool that can be used for the web-based information gathering phase.
